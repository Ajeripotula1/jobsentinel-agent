"""
Central place every part of JobSentinel (API, agent, poller) reads config from.

Why this exists instead of scattered `os.getenv()` calls:
  - One source of truth for what config the app needs. Read this file and you
    know every environment variable JobSentinel depends on — no hunting through
    the codebase for os.getenv() calls hiding in random modules.
  - pydantic validates types and required-ness at import time, not at first
    use. A missing DATABASE_URL fails immediately with a clear error instead
    of crashing deep inside a request handler an hour into a demo.
  - Locally this reads from a `.env` file (see .env.example). In AWS, Lambda
    and AgentCore inject the same variable names from SSM Parameter Store —
    application code never has to know or care which one it's running under.
    That's "12-factor config": config lives in the environment, not in code.
