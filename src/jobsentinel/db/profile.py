"""
Data access for the `profiles` table - the one place profile reads/writes
happen. Both the API (Slice 2) and the agent (Slice 3's query_profile_facts
tool) import from here rather than running their own queries - same
shared-data-access pattern as jobsentinel.db.jobs.

Append-only history: every submission inserts a new row rather than
overwriting one. get_latest_profile() is what makes that look like a
single "current profile" to callers - it's just the most recent row.

    `user_id`: pass the *authenticated caller's* id whenever `profile_id`
