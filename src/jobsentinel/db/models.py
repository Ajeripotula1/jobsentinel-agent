"""
ORM models - the single source of truth for the schema.

This project switched from hand-written Core `Table` objects + hand-written
migrations to SQLAlchemy's ORM + Alembic autogenerate. The tradeoff, made
explicitly: less time spent keeping a migration and a Table definition in
sync by hand, in exchange for trusting `alembic revision --autogenerate` to
diff these models against the live database and generate the migration for
you (which you should still *read* before running - autogenerate is a
starting draft, not something to blindly trust, especially for renames).

Every model inherits from `Base` below so they all register into one
`Base.metadata` - that's the object `migrations/env.py` points Alembic's
`target_metadata` at, which is what makes autogenerate possible at all.
