// Get the signed-in user's latest profile. No `id` param needed - GET
// /profile resolves "your latest profile" server-side from the Clerk
// auth token (see jobsentinel/api/routers/profile.py's read_profile),
// the same way get_current_user_id already scopes every profile route.
//
// A brand-new user who hasn't uploaded a resume yet gets a 404 from the
// API - that's an expected, normal state (not a real failure), so we
// catch it here and resolve to `null` instead of leaving the query in
// an error state. That lets ProfilePage tell "no profile yet, show the
// upload form" (data === null) apart from "the request actually failed"
// (isError === true) instead of treating both the same way. Any other
// failure (network down, 401, 500, ...) is re-thrown as-is so React
// Query puts the query in an error state and callers can render it via
// isError/error - see ErrorAlert.jsx, which reads error.message
// directly, which is why we re-throw the original ApiError rather than
// replacing it with a generic Error (that would lose the server's
// actual detail message).
//
// `enabled`: lets a caller defer firing this query - e.g. only run it
// once some other condition is true - instead of it always fetching on
// mount. Defaults to true so `useProfile()` with no args behaves like a
// normal query. See useQuery's own `enabled` option.
